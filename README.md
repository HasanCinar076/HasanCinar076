# Hasan Cinar
AI/ML Engineer | M.Sc. Candidate in Software Engineering

I build applied AI systems using LLMs, RAG, and NLP, with a focus on reliability, relevance, and latency.

I am currently pursuing a Master’s degree in Information Technologies (Software Engineering) at Tomas Bata University in Zlin, Czech Republic, and I am open to entry-level AI/ML Engineer roles and internships.

## Current Focus
- Designing and evaluating a multilingual, source-grounded RAG chatbot for academic knowledge access.
- Building end-to-end pipelines with chunking, embeddings, reranking, Chroma vector DB, FastAPI, and Streamlit.
- Measuring retrieval relevance, answer quality, latency, and user impact.

## Tech Stack
- Languages: Python, C++ (basic)
- AI/ML: Applied ML, NLP, LLMs, embeddings, vector search, RAG design/evaluation
- Frameworks/Libraries: LangChain, LlamaIndex, PyTorch, TensorFlow, Pandas, NumPy, Matplotlib
- Databases: SQL, Vector DBs (Chroma)
- Tools/Platforms: Git, GitHub, Google Colab, VS Code, OpenAI Codex, APIs/SDKs, Azure (basic)

## Featured Project
- [FitForecast - Gym Attendance Prediction](https://github.com/HasanCinar076/FitForecast)  
  Built and evaluated a machine learning pipeline for gym attendance prediction using historical data, preprocessing, feature engineering, and model validation.
